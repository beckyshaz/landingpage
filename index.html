        <h2>About BotCom</h2>
        <p>BotCom is an e-commerce chatbot that integrates with WhatsApp to help customers browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases with ease.
        The idea for BotCom emerged from my personal experiences as an online shopper. Frustrated by the lengthy checkout processes and lack of instant support during purchases, I envisioned a solution that could streamline these interactions. The journey began in ["October 2023"], when I decided to create a chatbot that could assist users from account creation to payment confirmation, making the online shopping experience smoother and more enjoyable.
        This project is part of my portfolio for Holberton School, where I honed my skills in Flask, Twilio, and SQL. You can view the complete project [on github](https://github.com/beckyshaz/Botcom)
